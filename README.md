# CDC2022_Greenhouse_Gas
### Honor: First-Place Winner Carolina Data Challenge 2022 
### Project: Greenhouse Gas Emisson 
### Authors: Tao Huang, Bang Gong, Lorry Zou

## What it does
We analyzed greenhouse gas emission by the regions' economic status and compared the emissions by advanced economies and developing countries.
## How we built it
We visualized the data with Python and R and built the model with R.
## Challenges we ran into
The dataset is relatively small and what could be concluded from the dataset is limited.
## What's next for Climate Injustice
The international society should stick to the current agreements on controlling greenhouse gas emission. The advanced economies should put in more efforts proportional to their per capita emissions in controlling global warming.
